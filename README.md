# Customer management app using Nest.js, Vue.js and MongoDB

This prototype is divided into two separate sections. Namely the backend ( Built with Nest.js) and the frontend
( Built with Vue.js ).

## Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm i
npm run start:dev
```
This will start the backend application on port `3000`.

## MongoDB
Ensure that you have mongoDB installed on your machine before running the application. I have this fully setup on my mac already.

Start mongoDB:

```bash
sudo mongod
```

## Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run serve
```
Open browser and view the application on http://localhost:8080
